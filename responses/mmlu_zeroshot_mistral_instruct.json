In its answer, the team included a counterclaim seeking $10 million in damages for losses caused by the city's alleged failure to properly maintain the stadium, as the lease required.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?\n(A)The federal court should hear the case on the merits. (B)The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question. (C)The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.

After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays.

The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion.

The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood.

The defendant, who had a history of psychiatric problems, had been diagnosed as being paranoid schizophrenic. The defendant was represented by a court-appointed attorney. In trying to prepare for trial, the attorney met with the defendant on numerous occasions. The attorney, however, found it difficult to communicate with the defendant, who, due to his paranoia, distrusted the attorney and believed he was working with the prosecution to convict him. The defendant was subsequently convicted. After the defendant was sentenced, the attorney filed an appeal seeking to overturn the conviction and have a new trial ordered. The appeal, in part, challenged the constitutionality of a state statute that placed the burden of proof on the defendant by requiring him to prove mental incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. In addition, the appeal claimed that the attorney was unable to provide adequate representation because there was a failure of communication between the defendant and his attorney. The appeal will most likely be\n(A)granted, because the prosecution has the burden to prove the defendant's competency by a preponderance of evidence.

The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery.

Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner.

The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss. (B)A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death. (C)A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death. (D)A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.\nA: ",

The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of\n(A)the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years. (B)the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.

She began looking for a home to purchase in the mountain community. She found one suitable location offered for sale by the owner. The asking price for the home was $100,000. Although the teacher was very interested in purchasing the home, she told the owner that she was not sure it would fit within her budget. The owner the grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the following:\"December 1In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. \" The owner then signed the paper and handed it to the teacher, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, the owner sent the teacher a letter in which the owner stated, \"Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing my offer to sell you my home. \" This letter was received and read by the teacher on December 16. The next day, the teacher tendered a cashier's check to the owner in the amount of $100,001 (which included the $100,000 purchase price plus the $1 consideration) and demanded a deed of conveyance to the property. The owner refused to accept the cashier's check. The teacher has now brought suit against the owner for specific performance. In her pleadings, the teacher admits that the recited $1 was not in fact paid to the owner when their written agreement was executed. Assume the teacher lives in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement of Contracts. As a result, which of the following is the teacher's best argument that such failure of payment does not bar her claim to specific performance?\n(A)The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance. (B)The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract. (C)By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.

Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries.

Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking.

A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n(A)Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.

(C)Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.

In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property.

In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created.

The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels.

Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor.

After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy.

Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course.

During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire.

The senior partner told the law clerk that the law firm was representing an important client on an urgent matter that needed immediate research. The law clerk was advised that he would be required to stay at the law office that night and prepare a memorandum. When the law clerk hemmed and hawed, the senior partner handed him the file and said, \"I don't care if you stay all night, but you better have this memo on my desk by 8:00 a. m. tomorrow. \"Following the senior partner's instructions, the law clerk stayed at the office until 2:00 a. m. preparing the memorandum. By the time he finished, the law clerk was totally exhausted after having worked a total of 17 hours that day. Afterward, the law clerk left the office and started to drive home. Because of his fatigue, he didn't see a pedestrian crossing the street. His car struck the pedestrian, seriously injuring herSThe pedestrian has asserted a tort action against the law firm to recover damages for her injuries. Which of the following is the most likely result?\n(A)The pedestrian prevails, because the law firm was negligent for requiring the law clerk to stay at the law office and finish the memorandum. (B)The pedestrian prevails, because the law firm is legally responsible for its employees' actions. (C)The pedestrian loses, because the actions of the law firm were not a cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's injuries. (D)The pedestrian loses, because the law firm is not responsible for the law clerk's negligence in these circumstances.\nA: ",

The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation.

On the south side of the river is situated a rural community with a population of 40,000. For many years, various civic groups have urged that both communities merge into one township with a single governmental body. Independent studies have indicated that such a merger would result in an enormous tax savings to the residents of both municipalities by eliminating the duplication of services. On one previous occasion, proponents of the merger pian succeeded in having the proposal appear as an election referendum in each community. Although the merger referendum passed in the industrial town by a sizable margin, the voters of the rural community rejected the measure, fearing the combined government would be dominated and controlled by its neighbor's larger representation. In order to alleviate the concern of the rural community's voters regarding under representation in a merged governmental system, the respective city councils of both municipalities appointed a steering committee to formulate a new proposal. Accordingly, the steering committee devised a merger scheme wherein the city council of the united city, would consist of eight members. Within this proposed new system of government, each former municipality would be divided into four districts. With respect to the industrial town, each district would consist of 25,000 persons and each would have one elected city council member. By the same token, the rural community would be divided into four elective districts, each containing 10,000 residents. One city council member would be elected from each of these districts as well. The mayor would be elected at large by a popular vote of all residents in the newly created eight districts. Before this merger proposal was placed on the ballot, the state attorney general issued an advisory opinion stating that the measure did not, in her opinion, violate any statutory or constitutional provisions. Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both municipalities. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from the industrial town initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the disproportionate representative districts. Which of the following represents the plaintiffs' strongest constitutional argument in support of their action?\n(A)The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the equal protection of the law. (B)The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the due process of the law. (C)The plaintiffs and other residents of the industrial town have been denied the privileges and immunities of citizenship as guaranteed by Article IV, Section 2.

At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife. The defendant had an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government claimed that it was showing motive by proving the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years and therefore his bad relationship with his wife. The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of 10 women regarding defendant's various sexual contacts with them over prior years. The defendant appealed the murder conviction, claiming that the women's testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. Will the appeals court likely reverse the conviction and order a new trial?\n(A)Yes, the trial was unfair in presenting testimony of women going back over 20 years; it would have been proper to admit such testimony only as to the five years preceding the crime. (B)Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse. (C)No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n(A)invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.

One building housed medical offices, and the other building housed dental offices. The first floors of both buildings were occupied by various retail establishments. The buildings' other floors were rented to professionals and used as offices. There was an enclosed walkway that connected the second floor of each building. Thus, shoppers and office staff could walk across the common walkway and gain access to each building. While the buildings were being used in this manner, the millionaire sold the dental building to an investor by warranty deed, which made no mention of any rights concerning the walkway. The walkway continued to be used by the occupants of both buildings. Thereafter, the walkway became unsafe as a consequence of wear and tear. As a result, the investor hired a contractor to repair the walkway area. When the millionaire saw the contractor removing the carpeting along the walkway, he demanded that the investor discontinue the repair work. After the investor refused, the millionaire brought an action to enjoin the investor from continuing the work. The most likely result will be a decision for\n(A)the millionaire, because the investor does not have rights in the walkway. (B)the millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building do not extend to the walkway. (C)the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.

During night time hours, when there were no employees in the warehouse, the building and its contents burned to the ground by a raging fire. The fire department ruled that the fire had an incendiary origin. The fire report, however, did not identify a perpetrator. The insurer responded by rejecting coverage and accusing the business owner of starting the fire. The business owner sued the insurance company in federal court for the policy proceeds to cover its property damages claim. At the trial on the business owner's civil claim for insurance coverage, the owner attempted to put several persons on the stand to testify to the owner's good character, which was submitted as proof that the owner did not commit the arson. The trial court ruled that the character evidence would be excluded because it was inadmissible character testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 404(a). On appeal, will the fedeal appellate court likely affim the trial court's order?\n(A)Yes, because Rule 404(a) is firm in not allowing for character evidence in a civil trial.

Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body. She later learned that the elevator had remained stalled for 50 minutes. Thereafter, it moved to the 20th floor, where she was found by her friend, who took her to the hospital. Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered. If the woman brings suit against the owner of the apartment building for negligence, she will most likely\n(A)recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building. (B)recover, because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator. (C)not recover, because the woman was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited the elevator. (D)not recover, because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\nA: ",

He assumed that a shoplifter had taken it. Later that day, the store owner was cleaning up the small room in the back of the store that the employees of the store used to store their personal items while they were at work. The store owner was straightening up the coat rack in the back room, when he accidentally knocked one of the employee's coats off the hanger. As the coat fell onto the floor, the missing electronic device fell out of the pocket of the coat. It was still in its original packaging, and the store owner checked the serial number on the package to confirm that it was the device missing from the store's shelves. The store owner knew that the coat belonged to a woman who worked as a cashier in the store. The store owner felt bad, but decided that he had no choice but to call the police. Two police officers arrived at the store. They gathered information from the store owner, who signed a criminal complaint against the woman. The officers then discussed the matter with the woman. Although she denied stealing anything, the officers arrested her and informed her that they would need to take her to the police station. After the police took the woman away, another employee of the store found out that the woman had been arrested. That employee immediately went to the store owner and admitted that he was actually the one who had stolen the device, and that he had hidden it in the woman's coat, intending to retrieve it later before the end of the woman's work shift. The store owner promptly called the police and told them that there had been a mistake and that the theft charge against the woman was invalid. The police released the woman, who spent a total of approximately 30 minutes in police custody. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the arresting officers, will the woman prevail?\n(A)Yes, because the woman had not committed a crime at the time she was arrested. (B)Yes, because the woman was arrested and held in custody. (C)No, because the woman was detained for only 30 minutes.

Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n(A)The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause. (B)The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n(A)It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language. (B)It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office. (C)It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.

In 1979, a neighbor, owner of a farm abutting the northeast corner of the 10-acre tract, began to use a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this particular jurisdiction was 20 years. In March 2000, the neighbor decided to sell the farm to a skier. Thereupon, the neighbor and the skier entered into a written real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000.

At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?\n(A)No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.

When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred.

Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n(A)The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner. (B)The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use. (C)The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need. (D)The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\nA: ",

In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\n(A)Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below. (B)Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary. (C)Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue. (D)Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\nA: ",

As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping. The applicable statute is defined as \"knowingly abducting a person and moving him or her to another location. \"Should the husband be found guilty of kidnapping?\n(A)Yes, because he unlawfully transported his son to another state, in violation of the divorce decree.

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently.

The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore.

When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be\n(A)granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial. (B)granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable. (C)denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing. (D)denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\nA: ",

The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that\n(A)the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use. (B)the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use. (C)the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood. (D)the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.\nA: ",

The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be\n(A)granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established. (B)granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him. (C)denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations. (D)denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.\nA: ",

According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees. (C)In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers.

The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits.

Two years of experimental use prior to commercial marketing had demonstrated that the machine laundered clothes more cleanly, more rapidly, and at a lower cost than any previous model. After nine months of commercial sales on a nationwide basis, the manufacturer discovered that an electrical unit in the machine tended to overheat greatly when the machine was heavily loaded or used continuously for more than one hour. The manufacturer promptly notified all dealers that it was recalling machines still in dealers' stock for corrective adjustment. It also provided all dealers with forms of notice to previous purchasers, warning the purchasers of the hazard, urging the purchasers to arrange with the dealers to pick up the machines, with full reimbursement to the purchasers (at the manufacturer's expense); and advising the purchasers who wished to use the machines pending pickup by the dealer to do so only with a clothes load of not more than one-half the machine's capacity and for no longer than three-quarters of an hour. A purchaser of a washing machine, having been notified, arranged on Thursday to have a dealer pick up her machine on the following Monday.

During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be\n(A)granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.

In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it.

(B)In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. (C)In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the buyer, as subsequent bonafide purchaser without notice of the prior rancher-to-son instrument, would acquire record title to the orange grove.

Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed. The examiners also requested information as to whether the graduate had ever been arrested, convicted, or placed on probation for a criminal offense. The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney. In addition, the letter provided detailed information about the facts related to the offense. As a result, the examiners hired a special investigator, to look into the matter. As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed. After all other attempts to gain access to the records proved futile, the bar examiners filed suit in federal district court demanding access to the relevant documents. The court should rule that, as applied to this case, the state statute regarding the sealing of juvenile records is\n(A)constitutional, because juveniles are entitled to the equal protection of the laws. (B)constitutional, because the state has a strong and legitimate interest in rehabilitating juvenile offenders, and this is furthered by protecting them from embarrassment in later life through revelation ofjuvenile offenses. (C)unconstitutional, because the bar examiners, as a quasi-judicial agency, is entitled to haveaccess to all relevant public documents. (D)unconstitutional, because it hinders the interests of justice by preventing the bar examiners from determining the fitness of candidates to practice law.\nA: ",

The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?\n(A)Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery. (B)Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.
